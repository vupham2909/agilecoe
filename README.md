## Martin Fowler

### [Using an Agile Software Process with Offshore Development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agileOffshore.html)

### Ambassadors visting and build relationship

- Have Each Site Send Ambassadors to the Other Sites and Use Contact Visits to build trust: This note about how important it is to visting offshore/onshore site to build trust, relationship that benifit project works and Agile.

### Agile that is change our culture
Don't Underestimate the Culture Change: To make agile methods work you need much more autonomy and decision making by the doers.

### Use wikis to contain common information

Using wiki to contain common information and remove needs of overwhelm documentation.

### How to document requirement in User Story

### Feedback loop

- Have the same test\production environment.
- Have the report on every build of what new is added. (Release note, build note or something need to be iron out).
- The quicker someone look at a piece of work. The quicker they can spot any miscommunication
- Do a review meeting, showcase to get the feedback loop at the end of the sprint.

### Use Regular Short Status Meetings

- Daily Scrums, Stand up meeting and do this over remote groups in important, so they can cordinate with other teams.
- At least twice a week stand-ups onshore/offshore should provide enough coordination.
- Have chit chat in the conference is good.

### Sync up working hours, calendar, holidays, leave plan, clock and timesheet is important

### Separate teams by functionality not activity

- The art of scale and divide teams remote
- Make the offshore team handle as many activities as possible.
- An important part of this is to grow the analyst part of the offshore team. The more someone local to the developers understands of the business, the more the development team can develop efficiently.
- The most important thing to remember here is the dominant power of Conway's Law - the structure of the system will mirror the structure of the team that built it. That means that it's important to separate distributed teams by modules that are as loosely couples as possible.

### Offshore team expect to need more document

- This cost included in the price of Offshoring.
- But what and how to document must come from the teams to the point of "just enough" documentation, and experiment until you get it right.
- Collaboration tools need to be invested.
- Don't think of keep updating these document.


### Get multiple and clear how teams use communication channel
- Phonecall
- IM
- Video screen sharing..
- Screenshot
- Screen gif
- Beside the coding part, it important to have a call/presentation of business and the big picture.

### Cost of offshoring
- Reason: if you could not find talented developers, then offshore.
- Cost of communication lead to manything and focus to return on investment

### Good to note

- Martin call it is Agile method.
- To make agile methods work you need much more autonomy and decision making by the doers.
- With greater distance, you need to put more ceremony into communicating requirements. We've been able to do that while still sticking to many of the techniques that we use in single-site development.

### What is the lesson learned here

- CI BUILD and sharing the same code base
- Relationship
- Autonomous team
- How to document requirement
- Important of the feedback loop around the working software on the same environment (UAT, DEV..etc)
- Communication channel and frequence.
- Short iteration is important (a week is good)
- The planning meeting need to be tailored: pre-work should be added as much as possible, so that the time in conference don't take much.
- Divide teams by functionality, and let teams work with PO to analyst and design their work. An important part of this is to grow the analyst part of the offshore team. The more someone local to the developers understands of the business, the more the development team can develop efficiently.  All this means that you have to focus on growing the business knowledge of the offshore analyst.
